# Emp_database
This is a project of an employee database.
I am still learning java so features will be added and removed as i go.

Current features : 
1-Add,edit and remove an employee.
2-View and search the whole list of employees.
3-pin creation and verfication for admin functions.
4-Annual increase for employes.

features to be added:
1-adding a sorting and a grouping feature in the search and view options.
2- actually add io operations to save in an external source as excel or a text file rather than temp.

changes that could be made:
1-change the whole code from methods over main to two seprate files one with main and 
one with a class that extends main and has all the methods that is already made.

2-probably clean ups on the way.
